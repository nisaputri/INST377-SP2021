    <h1>
      Welcome to INST377!
    </h1>
    <p>
      This article is to help you get set up with
      a development environment that will let you test your own labs to see
      whether you're doing it right, before you submit your work. It's a
      separate article from the main lab assignments because some of you will
      have gotten into the course late, and will need a reference for setting
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      INST377 is a technical course about human problems. This means
      that,&nbsp;more than anything else, INST377 is about learning to be
      comfortable with new, potentially frustrating technical experiences. In
      this course, you will be given professional tools, which should help a lot
      with basic problems in learning to code. Those tools have some
      expectations with them, though, notably that you're
      <strong>willing to read a lot</strong>, install things, and be very
      comfortable with things simply not working the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Most of programming is debugging and very carefully following
        instructions.</strong
      ><strong><br /></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following steps will be a little tricky, and need to be done in order,
      or you will not be able to submit your labs for this class. If you do not
      submit your labs, you can't get credit for them - but more importantly,
      you won't be able to practice your debugging before your group project.
    </p>
    <p>Let's do this together.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Install the software listed in the Required Course Software page.

      <li>
        Open a terminal window in your VSCode editor by clicking "Terminal &gt;

        If you have trouble with <strong>any</strong> stage of this, please ask
        for help in the class Discord! Your peers probably ran into the same
